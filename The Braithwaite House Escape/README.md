# The Braithwaite House Escape


## Description
Arthur Morgan and his friends from the Van der Linde gang have been captured by the notorious Braithwaite family. They are locked inside Braithwaite Manor, a large estate with multiple floors and rooms.

The Braithwaites have imprisoned Arthur and his friends in a house with `n` floors and `m` rooms on each floor. Each gang member is kept in their room, closely guarded by Braithwaite guards.
However, there's a secret room in Braithwaite Manor that Arthur and his friends plan to use as an escape route. When night falls, they can move to adjacent rooms for one second each. They can also choose to remain in their current room if they wish.

Arthur Morgan wants to determine the minimum number of seconds required for everyone to reach the secret room if they move optimally and avoid detection by the Braithwaite guards.
