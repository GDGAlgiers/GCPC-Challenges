# Notes 
- Each line of `input.text` reprsent a test case, there is 100.
- Each line of `solutions.txt` represent the repspective solution for the test case.
- With the given config, time limit should be 7s.
- If you want to have dynamic test cases (new cases each time) you can use `gen.py` to generate new cases though it may take some time to do so ~10s with the current config (can be changed in `config.py`).
